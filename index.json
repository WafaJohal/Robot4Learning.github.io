However, this interest is not new: the logo turtle entered schools nearly 40 years ago. Over this period, robots have changed a lot: sequentially or eventually programmable, they also integrate a wide spectrum of sensors and actuators. Hence, new applications in educational contexts can now be envisioned.\nThe Robots for Learning (R4L) workshop is in its 4th series, and the focus of this edition is on inclusive learning. Robots as educational agents have been studied and deployed in various forms – as tools, mediators, tutors, and peers. In this workshop, we aim to discuss the approaches and challenges of developing these educational robots to be more inclusive, helping learners of different ages, backgrounds, genders, and learning abilities. Learners with difficulties often need more attention or personalised training. With this workshop, we aim at discussing recent advances in empirical and theoretical state-of-the-art research contributions on human-robot interaction in educational contexts on the following challenges: How to design robots to adapt to learners abilities? How to build long-term learning with robots? How can robots engage learners in playful learning activities? How can robots assist learners in multimodal learning scenarios?\nWe invite authors to report previous research, practice and interest in developing application in educational robotics. Researchers from HRI, robotics and educational backgrounds are invited to contribute. Papers will be reviewed for appropriateness and scientific and technical soundness. Priority will be given to papers which fit the theme of the call, which are complementary, and which offer a range of theoretical and cultural perspectives.\nList of topics  Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors, personalization and adaptation algorithms for tutoring interactions Design of autonomous systems for tutoring interactions Theories and methods for tutoring (pedagogical and language acquisition) Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Human-robot collaborative learning Attachment and learning with a social robot (social and cognitive development) Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Human-robot relationship assessment Designing student models and assessing student’s learning Playful learning with a robot Human-robot creativity Kinesthetic and non-verbal communication in human-robot interaction Impact of embodiment on learning Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots Long term learning interactions, design and methodologies for repeated human-robot encounters Robots for learners with special needs and special abilities Education and re-training for adults Rehabilitation and re-education Privacy and ethical issues in robot tutoring applications  Invited Speakers  Iolanda Leite, KTH Elizabeth Broadbent, University of Auckland Brian Scassellati, Yale University  Program 9:00-9:30\nWelcome talk\n9:30-10:30\nSession 1\nMaryam Pourebadi and Laurel Riek, Expressive Robotic Patient Simulators for Clinical Education\nArzu Guneysu, Wafa Johal, Ayberk Özgür and Pierre Dillenbourg, Tangible Robots Mediated Collaborative Rehabilitation Design: Can we Find Inspiration from Scripting Collaborative Learning?\nPatrick Wang, Ilaria Renna, Frédéric Amiel and Xun Zhang, Learning with Robots in CS and STEM Education: A Case Study with ISEP-R0B0\n10:30-10:50\nCoffee break\n10:50-11:25\nIolanda Leite (KTH), Toward Adaptive Social Robots for Learning\n11:25-13:00\nSession 2\nEmmanuel Senft, Séverin Lemaignan, Madeleine Bartlett, Paul Baxter and Tony Belpaeme, Robots in the classroom: Learning to be a Good Tutor\nLujie Chen, Henny Admoni and Artur Dubrawski, Toward A Companion Robot Fostering Perseverance in Math – A Pilot Study\nHeather Pon-Barry, Nichola Lubold, Erin Walker and Amy Ogan, A Multimodal Approach to Adaptive Dialogue Interaction for Learning Companion Robots\nShruti Chandra, Ana Paiva and Pierre Dillenbourg, Children’s Perceptions of a Learner-Robot\nChristopher Wallbridge, Séverin Lemaignan, Emmanuel Senft, Charlotte Edmunds and Tony Belpaeme, Spatial Referring Expressions in Child-Robot Interaction: Let’s Be Ambiguous!\n13:00-14:00\nLunch\n14:00-14:35\nElizabeth Broadbent (Auckland Uni), Robots in schools: Salient issues and new perspectives\n14:35-15:10\nBrian Scassellati (Yale), Socially Assistive Robots for Special Populations\n15:10-15:30\nInteractive Discussions\n15:30-15:50\nCoffee break\n15:50-17:00\nSemi-structured group discussions\n17:00-17:30\nConclusions \u0026amp; Wrap up\nSelected Papers ","date":1552262400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552262400,"objectID":"393746ede82572e10cdec9bc7dffb2c1","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/events/hri2018/","publishdate":"2019-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/hri2018/","section":"events","summary":"Inclusive Learning","tags":["r4l","hri2018","hri"],"title":"R4L @HRI 2018","type":"events"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview Since several years, several research groups have investigated the use of robots for learning and teaching. Their work is divided into two main streams that we could call the interaction stream (i-stream) and the building stream (b-stream).The I-stream develops embodied agents able to conduct rich interactions with learners. These are mainly humanoids, part of humanoids or robotised animals that engaged learners in activities (writing, playing, counting, …) and are able to interact about these activities. These robots namely provide verbal and non-verbal hints, encouragement and feedback on several dimensions of the task: performance, cognitive (e.g. level of (mis-)understanding), social (e.g. regulation turn taking in teams), meta-cognitive or emotional. In the b-stream, the learner’s activities is to build the robots capacities. The most popular building activities consist of programming a robot such Thymio, mostly to acquire programming skills. Many other projects in the Makers or FabLab educational initiatives explore the physical construction of the robot either by assembling components from a toolkit such as Lego Mindstorms or by using 3D printing, wiring, etc. These construction activities usually include programming is well, but generally target broader learning goals, mostly STEM skills.\nWhile the I-STREAM addresses research questions that are very close to HRI and ROMAN topics, the work on the b-stream is generally addressed in other venues, creating a divide within those who explore robots in education. This workshop proposes to bring these two streams together because many developments that exist in one stream could also benefit to the other stream. A typical example of these synergies are situations where a humanoid (i-stream) and a learner jointly manipulate a graspable robot (b-stream). This workshop aims to create many more bridges between these two streams.\nList of topics  Learning activities in HRI Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Gain in learning vs fun in learning with a robot Observational and Kinesthetic learning in human-robot interaction Attachment and learning with a social robot Impact of embodiment on learning Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots The role of teachers in child-robot interactions Rehabilitation and re-education Human-robot collaborative learning Human-robot creativity Human-robot knowledge sharing Multi-party interaction and group interaction Mixed human, robot and virtual teams  Program 14:00-14:20 Welcome and Introduction\n14:20-14:45 Social Robot as an Awareness Tool to Help Regulate Collaboration in a Project Meeting.

While robots have been popular as a focus for STEM teaching (see Lego Mindstorms or Thymio), the use of robots as tutors is novel. The field of HRI has started reporting on how to make effective robot tutors and how to measure their efficacy. These studies have shown that the potential of robots in educational settings is inarguable: robot can provide educational content tailored to the individual, something which is missing from current educational settings. They also have the potential to enhance learning via kinesthetic interaction, can improve the learner’s self-esteem and can provide empathic feedback. Finally, robots have been shown to engage the learner, to motivate her in the learning task or to enhance collaboration in a group. However, many questions still remain. For instance, what interaction strategies aid learning, and which hamper learning? How can we deal with the current technical limitations of robots? How should effective lessons be developed and implemented on a robot? Answering these and other questions requires a multidisciplinary effort, including contributions from pedagogy, developmental psychology, (computational) linguistics, artificial intelligence and HRI, among others. The aim of this workshop is to engage scholars who aim to gain expertise in education and in robotics (from instructional design to inverse kinematics, ROS to ZPD, Markov to Piaget) into a new interdisciplinary community working on educational robotics. Participants will benefit from hearing from the forefront of field and from discussions on how to move from fundamental research towards the development of market-ready educational robots.\nList of topics  Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors, personalization and adaptation algorithms for tutoring interactions Theories and methods for tutoring (pedagogical and language acquisition) Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Gain in learning vs fun in learning with a robot Kinesthetic and non-verbal communication in human-robot interaction Attachment and learning with a social robot (social and cognitive development) Impact of embodiment on learning Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots Rehabilitation and reeducation Long term learning interactions, design and methodologies for repeated human-robot encounters Human-robot collaborative learning Human-robot creativity Design of autonomous systems for tutoring interactions Privacy and ethical issues in robot tutoring applications  Invited Speakers  Pierre Dillenbourg, EPFL, Switzerland  Selected Papers Uncanny Valley Feeling an Impact on Learning: A preliminary Experiment performed in a French Elementary School.
